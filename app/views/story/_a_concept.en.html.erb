<p>MagicBus was an idea. Now I had to make it real. So I came back from my New Zealand trip to continue my studies. I already had a diploma in technical architecture so I knew how to build technically but I wanted to learn more about how interior design works. I then completed a bachelor’s degree in interior architecture. After that, in order to plan the logistics of the bus and to increase my creativity, I moved to Montreal to complete a master’s degree in event design.</p> 

<p>Let’s see: I had the technical skills, the creativity to make a unique interior design, I knew how to organize the whole trip but I didn’t have any skills in business or management. So I decided to make my last year of studying in HEC Montréal in order to build the business case and have a minimum of knowledge to be able to build MagicBus as a business that could last.</p>

<p>After having the idea in New Zealand and sharing my vision with other travelers, I spent three years studying in order to make it as perfect as I can. It started to be tangible when I moved to Canada and the whole concept was developed and refined for a year with my HEC professors so I can be sure it will fit for our generation’s desires.</p>
