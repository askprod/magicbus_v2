<p>MagicBus was an idea. Now I had to make it happen. So I went back to France to continue my studies. At the age of 21 I already had a degree in architectural technique and was therefore able to create something technically realistic, but I wanted to learn more about interior design. So I went to Paris to do a degree in interior architecture. After that, in order to know how to manage the logistical aspects and to develop my creativity, I moved to Montreal (Canada) to do a DESS in event design.</p>
<p>At that time, I had the technical skills and creativity to make a unique layout, I knew how to organise the whole trip, but I still had no idea how to put together a business plan, go and get funding or even manage a project of this scale. I thus decided to do my last year of study at HEC Montreal in management, in order to build this famous business plan and to have a minimum of contacts and knowledge to make MagicBus a viable project on the long term.</p>
<p>In other words, after having had the idea in New Zealand and having confirmed the interest with other travelers, I spent 3 years studying in order to build my project. MagicBus definitely came to life when I moved to Canada. This is where the complete concept was developed and refined with the assistance of my professors. I wanted to be sure of the project's value and its ability to meet the needs of our increasingly nomadic generation.</p>
