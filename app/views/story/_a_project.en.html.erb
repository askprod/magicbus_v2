<p>Europe has always been my goal for MagicBus because of the open boundaries, the diversity, and the small size of countries which would let us experience many languages and cultures. Also, as I traveled around the world, I realized how Europe is rich and wonderful and so I wanted to go back to my roots. It was obvious that MagicBus would take place in Europe for his first version!</p>

<p>But, I lived in Canada for three years and I saw how Canadians liked the project and how Canada was amazing in terms of landscapes. Plus, I wanted to do it in an American school bus and they are very cheap in Montreal. A this point, I had a dilemma: I always imagined MagicBus going to Europe but wouldn’t it be better to start it here in Canada?</p>

<p>After weeks of analyzing the pros and cons between Canada and Europe, I decided to stay with my first feeling: Europe. Europe is the continent I grew up in but I know more about Canada or New Zealand when it comes to traveling. Since I am a ‘landscape and non-touristic places’ kind of traveler, and with Europe being known for its cities, I took it as a challenge to show Europe differently, out of the beaten tracks. I still plan on stopping in cities but it won’t be the main purpose of MagicBus trips. I want to make people feel and experience the different cultures and the natural richness of our historical continent.</p> 

<p>Let’s go to Europe!</p>
