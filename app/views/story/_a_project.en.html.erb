<p>Europe has always been my goal for MagicBus: a continent with open borders, great diversity and reasonably sized countries that give us easy access to multiple languages and cultures. Moreover, as I travelled further and further away, I came to realize how culturally rich Europe was and I was very attracted to the idea of going back to explore my roots. So it was obvious to me that MagicBus would travel to Europe first!</p>
<p>But here I was, I'd been living in Canada for almost three years. Canadians loved and supported the project, Canada is full of pure and incredible landscapes that I also dreamed of traveling through, and I was surrounded by such inexpensive American buses. So at that point, I was taken by a doubt: I had always imagined MagicBus in Europe, but wouldn't it be wiser to start it here in Canada?</p>
<p>After weeks of thinking, considering the pros and cons, I finally came to the conclusion that I had to follow my first wish: MagicBus will be in Europe. I am European, but I know Canada and New Zealand better than my own continent. And, because I am a traveller of "non-tourist landscapes and places" and Europe is rather known for its capitals, I saw this as a challenge: I want to show Europe in a different way, off the beaten track. Of course, we will stop in the capitals, but the cities will not be the main destinations of MagicBus, I will make the travelers embarking in MagicBus discover the different European cultures and the natural richness of our good old continent!</p>
<p>[ Canadian friends, don't worry, I plan to make the second MagicBus in caribou country! ]</p>
