   # method = 'handle_' + event.type.tr('.', '_')
   
   # event.type
   # This will give the name of the event. In our case, it will give ‘charge.dispute.created’ and replace the ‘.’ with ‘_’ so it will become ‘charge_dispute_created’ and concat it with ‘handle_’.
   # so it becomes ‘handle_charge_dispute_created’ as a method.
   
   # send method, event
   
   # This will call the method based on the method variable value. In our case, it will call ‘handle_charge_dispute_created’
   # Same way it will handle the other events based on your events you need to define the method in service put your code in it!
